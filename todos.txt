General:
Lightning (checkpointing, validation scores, lr_scheduler, 
    show ground truth for recon plot, reduce validation frequency,
    richtiger loss, activation sigmoid?, cifar batchsize erh√∂hen,
    checkpoin loading, bce loss with mean, weighting of loss terms)

Loss:
MSE vs. perceptual loss

Architectures:
Autoencoder
give the decoder downscaled versions of the input at different stages
run a feature extractor and a image reconstruction path in parallel

Layers:
sub-pixel (PixelShuffle), upsampling, transposed convolutions

Data:
different methods to create LR (bicubic,...)

Training:
clamp to [0,1] in training
